in this project I was able to better understand how to use grid and flex, two different ways of setting the pages I used in a different way, grid to create the rows of the various sections and how much space they had to occupy, flex instead to place the elements in the various sections, otherwise everything is quite simple to make, it will not be perfect but it is not even so horrendous, a fun project that makes you exercise and get in tune with html and css
